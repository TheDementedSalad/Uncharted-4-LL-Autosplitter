# Uncharted-4-LL-Autosplitter

This is done for free, but if you'd like to support me you can here.

# Instructions

Depending on which game you want to play, edit your splits and change the game name to either "Uncharted 4: A Thief's End" or "Uncharted: The Lost Legacy". A message should pop up saying an autosplitter by me is available. Click "Activate".

After activating the autosplitter, click "Settings". Place a checkmark next to every split you want to use.

Afterwards, create your splits. Name them anything you want (just make sure they correspond with a checkmarked autosplit). Order them however you'd like.

Make sure you compare against Game Time.

Any problems? Reach out to TheDementedSalad, he's in the UC Speedrunning Discord


# Something didn't split or split at the wrong time.

If a split of yours split at the wrong time, contact TheDementedSalad.
